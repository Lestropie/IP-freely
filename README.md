## "IP-freely": Free manipulation of BIDS data according to the Inheritance Principle (IP)

The goal of this software project is to create a BIDS App
that will automatically modify the storage of metadata
predicated on different versions of the Inheritance Principle.
The project is currently in the conception phase only.
To see the vision of what this App will do,
please check the [Issue list](https://github.com/Lestropie/IP-freely/issues).
